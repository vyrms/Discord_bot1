# Discord bot that does stuff

## これの日本語版 -> README.md

## About
Thanks for coming to see my bot!

This bot brings fun functions to the server!

The only thing that I have to say is that the bot works entirely with Japanese, so the people reading this probably can't use the bot anyways lol
(why am I writing this...)


## Functions in Discord
These are what the bot brings to the discord server
 - .help - displays all function that can be used

 - .coin n - does a coin toss n times

 - .dice n - dies a dice roll n times

 - .neko - says にゃーん(nyan)

 - .wikisearch word - displays a snippet of Wiki (ja) article about the word

 - .wikisuggest n word - suggests n words that are related to the word given

 - .teach trigger response1;response2 - bot learns a word/responses pair
 
 - .forget trigger - bot forgets the word/responses pair
 
 - .vocab - displays all word/responses pair the bot currently knows
 
 - when bot sees a trigger word, bot will respond according to what bot was taught
 
 - .choose choice1;choice2 - bot will choose one for you
 
 - 今日の運勢 (today's fortune) - tells how your fortune looks (in Japanese), and a lucky item

 - when bot finds a Haiku/Senryu, bot will repeat it and remember it

 - 詠め (sing) - sings a Haiku that the bot detected in the server


## Future directions
I didn't have a better title for this because of all the writing in college I'm going through

I don't plan to support English with my bot, probably

No plans
